                            So in this course so far, we've created two different projects now and they both work with some kind of data, the to do list work with to Dos, which is a form of data. And the weather app worked with location and weather data.
                            Now in both of those projects, if we refresh the page at any point, it would reset the application to their original state and it would not keep hold of any data.
                            <br><br>
                            We might have input to the website.
                            Now sometimes we want to do that.
                            If a user crosses off the website and comes back later or just refreshes the page, it would be nice to keep or persist the data that a user input and then show it on the application again.
                            <br><br>
                            Now how can we do that?
                            Well, to do that we could do one of two different things.
                            <ol>
                                <li>We could either set up a database on a server somewhere to store all of our data in, then retrieve that data whenever we start up the web application.</li>
                                <li>Or we could use local storage to store data in, which would mean we're storing the data locally in the user's browser and we can get that whenever our web app starts.</li>
                            </ol>
                            Now we're going to be looking at databases later on in the course.
                            But to begin with, I want to talk about <b>local storage.</b>
                            <br><br>
                            So the local storage API is provided to us by the browser and it gives us a way to store data and retrieve data to and from the browser itself.
                            <br><br>
                            That means when a user enters info on our web app, we can then store that in the browser's local storage on the user's computer.
                            <br><br>
                            Now, if at some point they refresh the page or cross it off completely and come back later, then we can access that data that we previously stored from local storage in the browser and inject it back into our application.
                            <br><br>
                            So in this chapter I'll be showing you all the basics of local storage, and then we're going to be updating our weather app from the previous chapter to use local storage as well.

                        <li class="font-weight-bold">Deleting storage data.</li>
                        <p>
                            <code>localStorage.removeItem('name');</code> <b>//=>THIS IS TO REMOVE A SINGLE ITEM</b>
                            <br>
                            <code>localStorage.clear();</code> <b> //=>THIS IS TO REMOVE ALL THE ITEMS</b>
                        </p>
                        <li class="font-weight-bold">Stringifying and parsing data.</li>
                        <p>Stringify turns an array of objects into JSON.</p>
